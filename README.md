Game Summary
Signal Lost immerses players in the role of a lone technician stationed on a remote space outpost. Tasked with maintaining basic systems, they begin receiving strange, fragmented messages hinting at a hidden purpose for the station—and the disappearance of its original crew. As systems glitch and power fluctuates, players must venture through dimly lit corridors, uncovering forgotten logs, scrambled transmissions, and cryptic audio clips. Each clue brings them closer to the chilling truth, all while something—or someone—seems to be watching.

With limited time and resources, players must decide which systems to repair and which secrets to pursue, risking their survival to piece together what happened on the station. Signal Lost combines survival mechanics with atmospheric exploration, immersing players in a tense, unraveling mystery set against the eerie silence of deep space.

Game Overview Theme / Setting / Genre Theme: Secrets and Survival in Deep Space. The theme revolves around uncovering hidden truths in an isolated, high-stakes environment. The player's sense of isolation and the eerie ambiance of deep space amplify the tension of discovering what happened on the outpost.
Setting: A remote, desolate space station orbiting a distant, uncharted planet. The station's power systems are faltering, leaving areas shrouded in darkness, with only the occasional hum of machinery breaking the silence. Evidence of the original crew’s activities is scattered throughout the rooms, adding to the station’s mysterious atmosphere. Flickering lights, static-filled monitors, and hidden messages embedded in various systems create an immersive environment filled with clues and unsettling secrets.

Genre: Sci-Fi Mystery/Survival This genre combines elements of mystery-solving with survival challenges. As the player explores, they’ll need to maintain their basic needs and repair essential systems while discovering increasingly disturbing truths about the station's purpose and its former inhabitants. The gameplay emphasizes atmospheric storytelling, puzzle-solving, and resource management under mounting pressure.

Core Gameplay Mechanics Exploration & Environmental Storytelling Players explore a non-linear space station, searching for clues in logs, audio files, and environmental details that reveal the station’s hidden secrets and backstory. Similar to: System Shock, Prey (2017), Soma Unique to Signal Lost: Clues are hidden behind layers of static, data glitches, and corrupted logs. Players have to "decrypt" messages by adjusting power and system settings, adding an interactive puzzle element to storytelling.
Resource Management & System Repair The player must balance resources (like oxygen, power, and basic tools) to survive and maintain critical station functions. Similar to: Alien: Isolation, Dead Space Unique to Signal Lost: Players allocate power between various systems, influencing what they can access or what parts of the story they uncover. Power shortages might lock some areas but reveal unexpected clues in others.

Isolation & Survival Mechanics The isolated setting adds a survival component where the player is vulnerable and dependent on limited supplies. Similar to: The Long Dark, Observation Unique to Signal Lost: The AI itself may interact with players in cryptic ways, sometimes causing malfunctions or displaying distorted messages that reveal parts of the backstory but only in fragments, heightening tension and paranoia.

Puzzle-Solving via Systems Manipulation Solving puzzles by manipulating station systems like life support, communications, and security controls. Similar to: Observation, Soma Unique to Signal Lost: Each system has multiple functions and power levels, requiring the player to reroute energy and deal with degraded systems to uncover secrets or open specific pathways, with consequences if handled incorrectly.

AI Presence & Adaptive Responses An ever-present station AI seems to act with unpredictable motives, affecting gameplay as players uncover its secrets. Similar to: Portal, Event Unique to Signal Lost: The AI’s responses vary depending on player actions. For example, the AI might reveal a hidden message if the player attempts repairs or could trigger unexpected malfunctions, creating a unique and evolving gameplay experience.
